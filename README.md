# Simple-Database-Manager
Python Database Manager I wrote to maintain data integrity for research purposes and possible deployment in conjunction with other python classes in Amazon Lambda.

It includes methods for Inserting, Checking for duplicates, Updating(on duplicate found), and Deleting based on a UNIX timestamp for a month out.
